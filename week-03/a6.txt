The first one took 3,932,320,116 nanoseconds
The second one took 39,296,500,043 nanoseconds
The third one broke the program we can estimate an answer based on the previous two. We added an extra digit, making it at least 10 times larger.
Therefore we can estimate that the third one will take approximately  390,296,500,043 nanoseconds to complete.
